# Halloween Challenge ðŸŽƒ

Welcome to the **Halloween Challenge** repository! This collection contains my solutions to the coding challenges presented on [Halloween.dev](https://www.halloween.dev/en/retos), a website dedicated to Halloween-themed coding puzzles and challenges.

## Overview
The challenges range in difficulty and cover a variety of programming concepts, providing a fun and spooky way to sharpen coding skills. Each solution is designed to solve a specific challenge from the site, with clear and concise code.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **challenge-XY.js.**: A solution file for a specific problem.
- **README in Each Folder**: Some challenges include a brief explanation in a README file to outline the problem and provide context for the solution.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gubiarpa/halloween-challenges.git
2. Navigate to a specific challenge directory to view or run the solution.
3. Follow any language-specific instructions if needed (e.g., node solution.js for JavaScript or python solution.py for Python).

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute by submitting alternative solutions or optimizing existing ones! Fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request.
